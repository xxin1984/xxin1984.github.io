<p>I am currently an associate professor in Beijing Institute of Technology. Before, I obtained the bachelor degree and the master degree from Tsinghua University (Beijing) in 2006 and 2008, respectively, and obtained the Ph. D degree from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Hong Kong, China) in 2011. My research interests are focusing on the structure prediction problem, based on designing the architecture of probabilistic graphical models and investigating the information fusion technique for heterogeneous features. I have applied these theories in the areas of natural language processing, knowledge engineering, and information retrieval. I select some of my work below. </p>
